# 3.1.0

* Add a new validator that can be used to validate incoming application proxy requests

# 3.0.1

* Fix an issue with paginating gift cards.

# 3.0.0

* ZfrShopify no longer explicitly specifies all the parameters in the descriptor. Instead, only the required fields are still validated, while others
parameters are all passed to Shopify API. The reason was that Shopify API is moving fast, and keeping up to date with all the new attributes (or missing ones)
was too time consuming. We lost a lot of hours of work trying to figure out why some of our API calls didn't work as expected, just to figure out that it was
because we forgot the property in the descriptor.

This change should make the maintenance much easier, and allow people to use last Shopify features without waiting for an upgrade of this package.

It should not cause any BC break, except that validation will no longer be performed on optional fields, but to be on the safe side, this version is now
tagged as 3.0.
